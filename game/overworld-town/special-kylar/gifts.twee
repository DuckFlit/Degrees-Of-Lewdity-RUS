    <br><br>

    "Can I eat it?" <<he>> asks.

:: Kylar Gifts Chilli Nod
<<effects>>

Kylar wolfs down the chilli con carne, as if starving. <<He>> stops only to wipe sauce from <<his>> cheek.
<br><br>

"Sorry I ate it so fast," <<he>> says when finished. "I don't get proper food often, let alone my favourite."
<br><br>

Kylar trembles as you sit beside <<him>>. <<He>> waits for you to take a bite, then joins in.
<br><br>
"It's very good," <<he>> says. It might be true, but it's impossible to tell from <<his>> voice. <<He>> eats as fast as you, waiting for you to take a bite before taking one <<himself>>.
<br><br>

You become used to the rhythm, each taking a bite in turn, so it's noticable when <<he>> stops. You look <<his>> way, and catch <<him>> watching you. <<He>> averts <<his>> eyes, and takes the final bite.
<br><br>

"Thank you," <<he>> says.
<br><br>

:: Kylar Gifts Bakewell Repeat

<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
    "I made it for you," you say. "Please eat it, and let me know if it's good."
    <br><br>
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
    "Don't make me repeat myself," you say. "Just eat it."
    <br><br>
<<else>>
    "I made it for you," you say. "Let me know how it is."
<</if>>
<br><br>

Kylar takes the bakewell tart from your hands, and takes a bite. "It's just like I remember," <<he>> says. <<He>> turns away from you, and refuses to show <<his>> face for a few moments. Then <<he>> continues eating the tart with measured movements.
<br><br>

"Thank you," <<he>> says when finished. "It was very good."
<br><br>

<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
    "We could eat it together," you say.
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
    "Let's eat it together," you say. "I deserve some too."
<<else>>
    "Let's eat it together," you say.
<</if>>
<br><br>

You sit beside Kylar, split the bakewell tart in two, and hand <<him>> a piece. You both take a bite. <<He>> turns <<his>> head away for a few moments. <<His>> face is flushed when <<he>> turns back.
<br><br>

"Thank you," <<he>> says when finished. "It was very good."

<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
    "You can eat it now if you like," you say.
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
    "I made it for you to eat," you say. "Not put it on display like a weirdo."
<<else>>
    "You should eat it," you say. "Food doesn't last forever."
<</if>>
<br><br>

Kylar looks shocked for a moment, as if your suggestion were sacriligious, then <<he>> makes an odd bowing motion. "I-I will." <<He>> shovels the food into <<his>> mouth without pause, somehow chewing and swallowing as <<he>> does. <<He>> consumes it in seconds, and looks to you for approval.
<br><br>

Kylar tucks it away. You wonder where it will end up.

:: Kylar Gifts Spicy Ask

<<if $speech_attitude is "meek">>
    "Is it spicy enough for you?" you ask. "I'm sorry if it's not."
<<elseif $speech_attitude is "bratty">>
    "I'm surprised you can handle it so well," you say. "Did I add enough spice?"
<<else>>
    "Is it spicy enough for you?" you ask.
<</if>>
<br><br>

Kylar nods with enthusiasm. "Yes! It's perfect. It's the best thing I've ever tasted. <<He>> starts eating faster, and almost chokes before finishing.
<br><br>

:: Kylar Gifts Spicy Watch
<<effects>>

You watch Kylar finish the meal. <<He>> doesn't seem bothered by the spice.
<br><br>

<<He>> seems unsure what to do with <<himself>> once finished.
