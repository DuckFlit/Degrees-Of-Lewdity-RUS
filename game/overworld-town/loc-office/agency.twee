How the security guards are just as devious and abusive, and how you are struggling to make enough money to keep yourself clothed and sheltered.

"You poor thing," <<he>> says, coming around to rest <<his>> strong hand on your shoulder. "I know how tough things can be for you, but I never imagined how bad things were. I wish I could do more for you, but our agency is contracted with this building and my hands are tied."
