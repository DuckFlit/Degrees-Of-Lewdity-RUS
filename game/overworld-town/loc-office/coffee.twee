As you wait for your lift to arrive, the <<person1>><<person>> and the <<person2>><<person>> follow behind you. You can feel their gaze on your back.
<br><br>

The lift arrives and the three of you get on. You press the button for your floor. "Looks like we're going to the same place," the <<person2>><<person>> says.
<br><br>

The lift reaches your floor, but before you can exit, the <<person1>><<person>> pushes past you, causing you to drop one of the packaged pastries from your order. As you bend over to retrieve it, the lift doors close around your waist! The <<person1>><<person>> turns around with a devious look in <<his>> eyes. Behind you, the <<person2>><<person>> grabs your <<bottom>>.
