The games continue, the stakes climb, and the tension rises. Avery empties <<person1>><<his>> <<wallet>>, then produces another roll of notes, held as one by a metal clip. It opens with a satisfying clack.
<br><br>

The chatter slows, then stops. Even Quinn is too intent on the game to speak.

All four keep raising the stakes. Each fancies their chances, or is at least making a good show of it.
<br><br>

You hang off Avery's shoulder and read <<person1>><<his>> cards. <<He>> has a very good hand. You push your <<breasts>> close to <<his>> face. <<He>> shakes you off with a little too much enthusiasm, and the other three all fold.
<br><br>

"That's the best we've seen this evening," Leighton says when <<person3>><<he>> sees Avery's hand. "And I almost made tonight's worst blunder."
<br><br>

Avery remains silent as <<person1>><<he>> collects <<his>> relatively meager earnings.

:: Avery Cards Distract Bailey

Bailey and Quinn are locked in a stalemate, each unwilling to back down. Lacking a chair, you kneel beside Bailey, and look at <<person2>><<his>> cards. <<He>> has a bad hand. <<Hes>> bluffing.
<br><br>

"Go do something useful," Bailey says without looking at you. You move away from <<him>>, but the agitation is clear in <<his>> voice, and the damage is done. Quinn smiles with renewed confidence, and Bailey folds.
<br><br>

"Sorry, old chum," Quinn says, giving you a wink as <<person4>><<he>> rakes in <<his>> winnings with <<his>> forearm.
<br><br>

You stand behind Quinn, opposite Leighton. You bend over and pretend to fuss about something on the floor, wiggling your <<bottom>> in the air.

It's hard to know if you're having the desired effect, until you hear Avery.
<br><br>

"Leighton," <<person1>><<he>> says.
<br><br>

No response.
<br><br>

"Leighton!"
<br><br>

"What? Oh, the game." <<person3>><<He>> looks unsure for a moment, then folds. It's soon clear this was the wrong decision.
<br><br>

Bailey and Leighton have folded, leaving the game to a duel between Avery and Quinn. You sit on the table, facing the former, but sticking your <<bottom>> out at the latter. The mayor can't resist giving you a hard spank. The sound claps through the room, breaking the tension.
<br><br>
"I didn't say you could touch <<phim>>," Avery says. <<person1>><<His>> voice is suprisingly calm. Too calm.
<br><br>
Quinn raises both hands and bows <<person4>><<his>> head. "Sorry, my friend," <<he>> says. "I took liberties, and I'm not too petty to admit it. Here." <<He>> folds, giving Avery the win. It was a good hand too.
<br><br>

The games continue, until Bailey glances at the clock on the wall. "One more," <<person2>><<he>> says. "I have somewhere to be."
<br><br>

The cards are dealt. The players regard their cards with stoney expressions.
<br><br>

"If this is the last game," Avery says, producing another clip of cash, "we should make it interesting." <<person1>><<He>> pushes the whole wad into the middle of the table. Quinn and Leighton match <<him>>, but Bailey shakes <<person2>><<his>> head.
<br><br>

"I don't have the cash to spare," <<he>> says.
<br><br>

<<Hes>> about to fold, until Quinn interjects. "Hold on," <<person4>><<he>> says. <<His>> eyes rest on you.
<br><br>

Avery realises the implication at once. "The <<girl>> is with me," <<person1>><<he>> says, a tremor of anger in <<his>> tone.
<br><br>

"The <<girl>> is with you," Bailey agrees. "But <<pshe>> belongs to me." A dreadful silence follows.
<br><br>

Quinn breaks the tension with a tap of <<person4>><<his>> fingers. "We're friends here," <<he>> says, leaning towards Avery. <<He>> speaks in a lower voice. "Let's not ruin it."
<br><br>
Avery doesn't look away from Bailey. "Fine," <<person1>><<he>> exhales at last. "Are you wagering the <<girl>> or not?"
<br><br>
Bailey hesitates, until <<person2>><<he>> regards the pile of money on the table, and looks at <<his>> hand once more. "I'll wager the <<girl>> for one evening. Deluxe rules." <<He>> looks at you. "Climb on."

A mask in the shape of an elk's head stares into you. It's large enough to cover the whole head. "It's a masked party," Avery says. "The elk is mine. The fox is yours."

You walk down a corridor with Avery, past more dog-masked guards, as well as servants in rat masks rushing to and fro. You hear voices, and music, up ahead, growing louder.
<br><br>

You emerge into a large hall, its ceiling adorned with chandeliers. There are tables holding food and drink to the sides, but most of the room is empty, save for the dozens of elks and foxes. On the far side is an array of stone archways, like window frames, arranged in a semi-circle. It looks like part of a separate structure, far older than the manor.

You wander away from Avery, and soon lose <<person1>><<him>> among the other elks. You notice a couple of rats through one door, their masks raised, having cheeky cigarettes out a large open window.
<br><br>

A hand lands on your shoulder. It's Avery. "Don't walk off again," <<he>> says, <<his>> voice tinged with anger. The mask is thick and deep, you can barely make out the whites of <<his>> eyes. "You're not safe here without me."

<br><br>
"Thank you for coming," <<person2>><<he>> begins. "Today we observe the ritual of renewal. Please, take your places."
<br><br>
The elks gravitate to one half of the hall, and stand in a line. Avery does likewise, but <<person1>><<he>> keeps a close eye on you. The foxes seem less certain, but some form into a line on the opposite side of the hall, mirroring the elks. You take position opposite Avery.

The elks and foxes create paths for the pair to run. They set upon the <<person>> as soon as they reach <<him>>, stripping <<his>> clothing and assaulting <<him>> from both sides.

<<He>> struggles weakly, but each touch makes <<him>> cry and spasm. The silver-fox howls again. The hall shakes with the response.

More dog-masked guards flood into the hall, surging towards the <<person4>><<person>> and joining the orgy. The silver-fox continues to howl, as if giving orders.

A <<person4>><<person>> appears on the screen. <<Hes>> stood in a small room made of stone bricks, like a medieval cell. <<He>> looks afraid. Quinn watches the screen as well, throwing the occasional glance your way as if to gauge your reaction.
