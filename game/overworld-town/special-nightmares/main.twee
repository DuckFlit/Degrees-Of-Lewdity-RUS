	<br><br>
	"Through here," <<he>> urges, almost dragging you as the feeling in your legs begins to return.

	You know the room that lies beyond the door. It's the prayer room, the incense filling the air.

	Hesitantly, you remove your own clothes, accepting help from Sydney's excited hands.

	"Relax, dear," Sydney says once more. More tentacles appear.

	"Come on," Sydney says, urging you to your feet. Blinking, you oblige, leaning on <<him>> as your legs get their feeling back. "You chose properly, I promise."

	You stumble as Sydney guides you forward. Smoke surrounds your feet with every step. A new door appears in the never-ending landscape, opening without anyone touching it. You're led to and through it.
	<br><br>
	The area beyond it is reminiscent of the Temple with some changes. The ornate altar in the centre draws your eyes.
	<br><br>
	Sydney stops, cradling your face in <<his>> hands. "You need to be purified. You've been letting that false me touch you. It's okay, I don't blame you. You didn't know."
	<br><br>
	Your legs are stronger now, making it easy to descend the steps and climb onto the altar. Sydney helps you to undress and instructs you on how to lie down. Every step of the way <<he>> utters encouraging words.
	<br><br>
	The final step is to be adorned with holy oils as Sydney sings a prayer. When <<he>> is satisfied, <<he>> steps back and nods with approval. "You're ready. Please don't fight this."
	<br><br>
	A chill settles in your skin as Sydney steps away. Fight what?
