You're reading "Raul and Janet".
<br><br>
The book tells the story of two lovers from the seventeenth century. Raul is the son of a poor tailor, but instead of honest work, he prefers to search for adventures. Janet is a young, polite girl from a wealthy family and the daughter of a local baron and the ruler of the city. Despite the differences between them, they fall in love with each other, but Janet's father is against their acquaintanceship, stating that the street boy is not the right fiancé for his daughter. One day, Raul convinces his beloved to run away together.
<br><br>
As it turns out, the baron's fears were real. When Janet's father orders him to leave his daughter alone, the boy brutally kills him, burns the court, and returns to a girl who does not know what happened. They make love the same night.
<br><br>
With each act, the book becomes darker and scarier. Every time you read it, you envision an innocent, pure girl in a white dress and her dangerous and lustful lad. You feel a mix of jealousy, lust, and anger. And you like it.
<br><br>
<<if currentSkillValue('english') gte 600 and $arousal gte ($arousalmax / 5) * 2>>
	You're not just reading a book anymore. All of the scenes and emotions are described so perfectly that you clearly feel like you are there. Like you are one of them.
	<br><br>
<<else>>
	You think this will be one of your favourite books. You plan to return to it more often.

A duel begins between Raul and William. Raul has the upper hand, but the moment he is about to kill William, Janet stabs him with a dagger.
<br><br>
He gets furious and strikes her back, accidentally piercing her with a sword. He is shocked once he realises what he's done. William seizes the opportunity to finish his opponent with his blade.
<br><br>
The story ends with both would-be lovers looking into one another's eyes for the last time, before the darkness overwhelms them.
