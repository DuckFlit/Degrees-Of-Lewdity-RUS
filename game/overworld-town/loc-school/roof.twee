:: Whitney Roof Bully Watch
<<effects>>

Whitney's friends pay you no attention as you join their circle around Whitney. "On the count of three," <<person1>><<he>> says. "I push you over."
<br><br>
"One," <<he>> pushes the <<person2>><<person>> further over the edge. The <<person>>'s knuckles turn white as <<he>> grips the railing.
<br>
"Two," <<person1>><<he>> gives the <<person2>><<person>> a violent shove. The victim's arms flail.
<br>
<<if $rng gte 51>>
    <<npc "Doren" 3>>
    "Three!" Whitney grasps the <<person2>><<person>> with <<person1>><<his>> other hand, and hurls the student off the roof. <<person2>><<He>> screams as <<he>> falls, but you don't hear <<him>> hit the floor. The scream is replaced with a sob.
    <br><br>
    Whitney's friends rush to the railing to observe, pushing you with them. You arrive to see Doren below, holding the <<person2>><<person>> in <<person3>><<his>> arms.
    <br><br>
    "You've crossed a line Whitney," Doren says as <<he>> rights the <<person2>><<person>> to <<his>> feet, <<person3>><<his>> voice uncharacteristically cold.
    <br><br>
    "Nah," Whitney replies, lighting a cigarette. "I knew you were there."
    <br><br>
    "Detention," says Doren. "You need help." Whitney is already turning away.

    "Whitney!" shouts a voice from below. It sounds like Sirris. "I know that's you! Let the <<person2>><<personsimple>> down!"
    <br><br>
    Whitney considers a moment, as if wondering how to interpret the teacher's words. Then <<person1>><<he>> pulls the <<person2>><<person>> away from the precipice, and lights a calm cigarette.
