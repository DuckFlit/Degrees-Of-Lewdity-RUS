			<br><br>
			You open the locker. The inside is nearly completely bare and a thin layer of dust coats the bottom. Checking the adjacent locker numbers, you realise this is probably Kylar's locker. It seems the police cleaned it out for evidence.
			<br><br>
		<<else>>
			<br><br>
			The first thing you see is your own face, staring back up at you from a piece of paper. The sight makes you jump back in surprise. <<gstress>><<stress 10>>
			<br><br>
			Calming yourself, you step closer to examine the locker and realise it's Kylar's shrine, consisting of a lewd statuette with a pencil portrait of your face taped to its head. Flowers circle the base and several portraits dot the sides of the locker, each depicting you in excruciating detail. You're not sure when they were drawn. 
			<<if isLoveInterest("Kylar")>>
				<br><br>
				You gently close <<nnpc_his "Kylar">> locker and step away, unwilling to steal from your <<print C.npc.Kylar.pronoun is "f" ? "girlfriend" : "boyfriend">>.

		<<if C.npc.Whitney.state is "dungeon">>
			<br><br>
			You open the locker. Dust motes puff out from the inside and you barely stop yourself from sneezing at the onslaught. Once the urge to sneeze abates, you begin picking through the dusty mess of discarded exam papers and cigarette cartons only to find a lost persons poster. Whitney's face is stamped on it; this was Whitney's locker.
			<br><br>
			With nothing to steal, you close the locker.
		<<else>>
			<br><br>
			Opening the door, a wave of stale air hits you, making you wince. Inside the locker is a mess of wrappers, crumpled up paper, and stray cigarettes. Tucked against the back is a discarded homework assignment covered in doodles and chicken scratch. Even with the smudged lead, you can clearly make out the name "Whitney" at the top.
			<br><br>
			<<if isLoveInterest("Whitney")>>
				 You cast a quick glance around and close the locker hurriedly. No sense in provoking Whitneyâ€™s temper.
			<<else>>
				You close the locker.

	<<addinlineevent "RobinLocker" 0.015>>
		<br><br>
		The interior of the locker is surprisingly bare. There's little in the way of decoration and the only items inside are a few short pencils and a binder you instantly recognize as Robin's. The sheer bareness of the locker heavily reminds you of Robin's own room back at the orphanage.
		<br><br>
		<<if isLoveInterest ("Robin")>>
			With a small smile at the reminder of your <<print C.npc.Robin.pronoun is "f" ? "girlfriend" : "boyfriend">>, you close the locker.

		As soon as you open the door, something clatters to the floor. You crouch down to pick it up; it's a red pen with the cap still firmly attached. A quick scan of the locker reveals dozens more neatly stacked into boxes against the walls of the lockers, alongside textbooks and a small umbrella. A cross hangs at the back and you realise the locker likely belongs to Sydney.
		<br><br>
		<<if isLoveInterest ("Sydney")>>
			You quietly marvel at Sydney's collection of pens before closing the locker.
		<<else>>
			You close the locker.
