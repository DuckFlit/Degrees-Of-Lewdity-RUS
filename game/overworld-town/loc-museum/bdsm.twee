Winter smiles. "I'm glad to hear it," <<he>> says. <<He>> places the pot in a surer spot and disappears into a back room.
When <<he>> emerges <<he>> holds a bundle of taut rags.
<br><br>

"This is the outfit." <<He>> holds the cloth out so you can see. They still just look like rags. You're not sure how you could wear them. Or how much they would cover.
"They're sturdier than they look. Get dressed and I'll get the camera. We'll need to advertise. A picture of you looking the part should suffice."
<br><br>

Winter disappears once more. You undress and wrap one rag around your waist, where it almost feels like a skirt.
The other you wrap around your chest. It's enough to cover your <<breasts>>.

<<He>> returns with the camera, and smiles. "Perfect. Try to look scared." <<He>> takes a picture, but then pauses.
"Would you mind sitting on the horse? We don't need to bother with the binds or anything, but I think that might work better."
<br><br>

You climb atop the wooden horse and ease yourself down. The hard wood pushes between your <<print ($player.ballsExist ? "testes" : "labia")>>.
You try to push your short, taut skirt between your legs for protection, but it's no use. You're not going to be able to sit on this properly without discomfort.
<br><br>

Winter takes a final picture. <<He>> seems satisfied. "Thank you. This should do the trick." <<He>> leaves you to get dressed.

"You'll be tied down," <<he>> continues. "But we don't need to submerge you completely. Expect to get wet.

You follow Winter around the hedge. There's a large crowd, maybe a hundred people, stood around the ducking stool. They look at Winter, and at you, eager to begin.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Winter begins, gesturing for you to take a seat. "Today we are here to witness the punishment of this rapscallion."
<<He>> pulls the straps over you, and binds you down tight. "A con artist, who swindled many good citizens. Now <<pshe>> faces justice."

It's cold. You wonder how long the demonstration will last.

"Such a punishment was not usually fatal," Winter says, pulling the lever in the other direction. You begin to rise. "Public humiliation was the primary goal."
The audience murmur amongst themselves. With a flash of panic, you look down to make sure the rags have not soaked to transparency.
Before you can get a good look, Winter plunges you into the river once more, this time up to your neck.

With a final push of the lever, the chair lowers the rest of the way, submerging you.

Winter wraps a heated towel around you, and then a second, for the journey back to the museum. "You did well," <<he>> says on the way back.

<<He>> glances back. Much of the audience is following. "I think we've earned some new interest."
