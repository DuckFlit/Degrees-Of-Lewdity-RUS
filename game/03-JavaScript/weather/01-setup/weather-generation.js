/**
 * Temperature Explanation:
 * 	Temperature calculations work by setting a number of key-points per month.
 * 	Key-points represent specific days where the temperature is defined, and temperatures for other days are interpolated between these points.
 * 	The number of key-points is selected randomly within a specified range set below in 'months'.
 *
 * Weather Explanation:
 *	Determines the current weather condition based on a series of key-points, similar to temperature.
 *	Instead of several key points per month - it instead uses 1 to several key points per day. (set in settings below)
 *	This leads to a more realistic weather pattern. It interpolates between weather types realistically (e.g. to go from clear to heavy rain - it must first be cloudy)
 *  Every season has its own probability for each weather type, set in weatherTypes, below.
