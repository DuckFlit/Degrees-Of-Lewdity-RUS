The roof piece is a bit heavy, but you lock it in place after a few tries. Finally, you carve sticks and tie bent pieces of junk to the tops to serve as hangers. You use lurkers for heavier hangers. Their stiff limbs stay in place when you bend them.

You gather your materials, and start to bind leather and fabric together into a simple rope. You give it a tug. It holds.
<br><br>

It will serve as the trapping mechanism, but for now you're using it to sling the rest of the materials you need over your shoulder as you walk down the stairs to the courtyard of the castle.
<br><br>

You look around for a good spot, and see a bit of displaced grass. Something travels back and forth here frequently. You dig a small hole and drop in a piece of thick wood, and get to work rigging up the trap. You use a piece of shiny junk as bait.
