The <<beasttype>> descends into the water beside you, <<bhis>> wings folding against <<bhis>> body as <<bhe>> swims effortlessly. You marvel at the sight of <<bhim>> gliding through the water, <<bhis>> feathers shimmering.
<br><br>

<<bHis>> keen eyes lock onto the colourful fish weaving through the shadows below. <<bHis>> body tenses with anticipation, wings subtly adjusting for a swift descent. Without a sound, <<bhe>> swoops down, diving gracefully towards <<bhis>> prey, the excitement evident in <<bhis>> focused movements, snatching a fish in <<bhis>> talons before resurfacing with a triumphant flourish.
<br><br>

<<if $monster is 1>>
	<<bHis>> voice fills with excitement as <<bhe>> shares <<bhis>> knowledge of the lake's inhabitants, using the fish in <<his>> grasp as a visual aid.
<</if>>
Occasionally, a cautious fish approaches you, its sleek form gliding effortlessly through the water as it investigates this new intruder in its domain. You watch in fascination as it circles around you, its eyes gleaming with curiosity before darting away into the depths once more.
<br><br>

A sense of contentment settles over you. The worries and troubles of the world fade away, replaced by a profound sense of peace and connection. In this moment, surrounded by the beauty of the night and the company of your <<beasttype>>, you feel alive. <<stress -12>><<trauma -12>><<llstress>><<lltrauma>>

The <<beasttype>> watches over you with a quiet reverence, <<bhis>> lonely existence momentarily forgotten in the light of your shared flight.
Nestled against <<bhis>> feathered chest, you feel the gentle rhythm of <<bhis>> heartbeat, a soothing melody that lulls you.

You hesitate, feeling a pang of uncertainty. Despite the <<beasttypes>> gentle entreaty, the thought of being whisked away into the night fills you with unease. With a heavy heart, you shake your head, declining <<bhis>> request.
<br><br>

For a moment, a flicker of sadness crosses <<bhis>> eyes, <<bhis>> wings drooping slightly in disappointment. Without a word, <<bhe>> curls up in the nest.

You get to work securing the tarp to the roof. You decide to place it under the holes rather than on top of the tower so there's no chance it will blow away. You angle it so water drains into the rainwater pool.
<br><br>

Having tools makes it simple, and with some wood for proper weight distribution, it seems secure. You give it a hefty tug, and it stays in place. You step back and admire your work. <<stress -6>><<lstress>>

Pulling the tarp back down is a chore, but you manage after a bit of a struggle.

You cut a hole in it and bind some leather and fabric around it on the other side. It takes a few attempts, but eventually you get the perfect shape to keep water from flowing through the hole while allowing smoke to escape.

You get to work demolishing the old nest. It doesn't take long. You throw out any old wood or leaves and sort anything still usable by size and strength.
You also make sure to save the fabric from your last improvements to the nest.
<br><br>

Inspiration strikes you, and you decide to make the nest raised from the ground. You cross large pieces of wood as a foundation, leaving space for the nest itself to hang.
You also add in some random shiny junk. It won't improve the structure, but it's inexplicably pleasing to look at.
Your spouse works on the nest itself, and the two of you lift the base of it onto the frame you've made.
<br><br>

While <<bhe>> finishes meticulously placing each stick and log, you begin to sew fabric and lurker leather into small sacks. You fill them with leaves and feathers. It's the closest thing you'll get to a pillow out here.
<br><br>

You fill the nest with leaves, and throw two sewn sheets of fabric over the top. They're large enough to hang over the edges. Finally, you throw in your makeshift pillows. All that's left is to test it out.

With a little more elbow grease, you could vastly improve the design of your drying rack.
<br><br>

You start from scratch, carving the legs and rods out of sturdy wood capped with a bit of scrap to protect it from the heat.
You then thatch together side supports with sticks and leather, allowing the whole assembly to fold in and out for easier storage.
<br><br>

Once that's done, you get to work building a ventilated cover for it. The strange fumes should harmlessly escape the tower, now.
<br><br>

You wipe your forehead and admire your handiwork. You should be able to dry out plenty of lurkers at once.

You collect some of your finds from hunting. You begin to place them in parts of the tower that look too vacant. A piece of torn up clothing here, a lurker hung there.
<br><br>

It's simple, but it makes the tower feel more homely. <<stress -6>><<lstress>>
<br><br>

You get lost in thought for a moment. With proof of your hunts, you have the urge to return to the sky with your spouse. <span class="blue">You can now ask the Great Hawk to go flying with you, when weather permits.</span>

You collect your hunting trophies. You build a small effigy near the broken wall, with firewood as a base. You dress it with a piece of torn clothing, fill it with leaves, and top it with a crown of lurkers. You pile up some shiny things around the base.
<br><br>

It looks a little uncanny. You're not entirely sure why you built it, but seeing your things collected together like this is pleasing nonetheless. <<stress -6>><<lstress>>

It takes a long time, but when you're done, it's large enough to cover the entire broken wall. You use a long stick and some wood to fashion a simple opening mechanism. You show your spouse how to open it.
<br><br>

Your nest looks a little plain. You embed a piece of fabric with some of the shiny junk you've collected, and tie it to the base, hanging over the edge of the tower.
<br><br>

You build a simple display rack for a particularly empty section of the tower, using fabric and leaves as a pleasing backdrop for some valuables you've stolen.
<br><br>

You add some more shiny things to the shelter tarp above you, then move to your mirror. You use your tools to carve a new wooden frame for it to slide into, and add some leaves around it for a natural look. You hang some lurkers from the top. You step back and look around the tower again. Being surrounded by little memories like this is reassuring. <<stress -24>><<trauma -6>><<lllstress>><<ltrauma>>

Despite everything you've managed to get, you still feel like you're missing something. Something to definitively prove you're the best hunter in the moor. You step to the perch and look out, wondering what you could find to prove your hunting superiority.
<br><br>

You consider your options. The moor itself has nothing special, neither do the animals that inhabit it. That leaves one option: humans. Not only are humans the most dangerous, they're also the most greedy. They're sure to have something. Though not just anyone will have what you need. You continue staring off into the moor, trying to come up with something.
<br><br>

Eventually your mind settles on the
<<if $remy_seen is "farm" or $remy_seen is "livestock" or $livestock_intro isnot undefined>>
	Remy estate. Knowing the kind of business they do, you're sure they would have something special.

With the silver bar as proof of your hunting prowess, it's only fitting to put it somewhere it can stand out as your crown jewel.
<br><br>

You get to work constructing a wooden pedestal for it. It takes some work, but the end result is one beautiful pedestal to place your prize on. You lift the silver bar up with both hands and place it on its new mount, resting on a bit of lurker leather.
<br><br>

After you're done, your <<beasttype>> comes over to inspect it. <<bHe>> looks happy with your work, though <<bhis>> attention is mostly taken by the silver bar itself. With how distracting the shine of it can be, you decide to sew together a nice piece of cloth to cover it. You place it on the silver bar for now.

You pile up a bunch of wood and prepare your tools. This will be a big project.
<br><br>

Wood carving takes up the bulk of the time. You need to make sure it has the right shape and structure. Once you have a standing frame, it becomes much easier.
<br><br>

The walls are next. You use your largest pieces for it, and use a mix of fabric and leather to bind pieces together. You wish you had some glue. You carve notches near the top as even as you can, both to accept a roof piece and for sticks to support hangers.
<br><br>

The roof piece is a bit heavy, but you lock it in place after a few tries. Finally, you carve sticks and tie bent pieces of junk to the tops to serve as hangers. You use lurkers for heavier hangers. Their stiff limbs stay in place when you bend them.
<br><br>

You stand up and admire your work. You swell with pride. <<trauma -12>><<lltrauma>>

It will serve as the trapping mechanism, but for now you're using it to sling the rest of the materials you need over your shoulder as you walk down the stairs to the courtyard of the castle.
<br><br>

You look around for a good spot, and see a bit of displaced grass. Something travels back and forth here frequently. You dig a small hole and drop in a piece of thick wood, and get to work rigging up the trap. You use a piece of shiny junk as bait.
