	"Always fly high, prey won't see you," <<bhe>> instructs. "Be fast. Never let prey anticipate your strike." You keep flying over the moor, looking for an opportune moment. Soon, your mate spots something. "There," <<bhe>> says, turning towards movement in the heather. A scattered group of lurkers. "Watch. Will show <<wife>> how to strike."
	<br><br>

	True to <<bhis>> word, <<bhe>> swoops down like lightning and grabs one in <<bhis>> talons. <<bHe>> barely loses any speed, returning to your side quickly.

You came here to hunt, and hunt you will.
<br><br>

Using your wings to swoop downward isn't something you're familiar with, but your instincts guide you. It feels similar to muscle memory, as your wings fold and your arms rear back for a grab. Your mind hones in on your target, and the rushing air is all you can hear. The lurkers aren't expecting another attack, allowing you to catch one easily.
<br><br>

The recovery isn't as easy. The sudden weight shift and the returning force from grabbing an object at high speed throws you off balance. You manage to right yourself, but you're too close to the ground. You instinctively lower your legs, making contact with the ground. You run with your momentum and use the speed to take off again.
<br><br>

It struggles in your hands. You manage to pick up wind and soar to the sky. As soon as you reach the clouds, the creature falls limp.

<<effects>><<set $location to "estate">>

The flight over to the estate is mostly uneventful, but the air is tense.
<br><br>

You arrive near the front of the estate, staying high enough to not be noticed. The view from up here should help you spot anything of interest. You waste no time and start circling.
<br><br>

You do many laps around the perimeter. Your <<beasttype>> follows you, unsure what else to do. After a while you return to the front and ponder your findings.
<<if $estate>>
	You know how well defended the stone building is, not to mention those in the cottage ready to rush over to help defend it.
<<else>>
	You saw many guards around the stone building. It most likely has something worth taking, but it's clear that even with the help of your <<if $monster is 1>><<nnpc_wife "Great Hawk">><<else>>partner<</if>> you couldn't get in there. The cottage nearby would be more accessible, but it's unlikely to have anything you'd want.
<</if>>
<<if $livestock_intro isnot undefined>>
	You know what the barn holds, and know there's no point in trying to get in there.
<<else>>
	Despite the guards near the barn, you doubt it holds anything of value to you.
<</if>>
<br><br>

The manor itself would likely have what you want, but trying to get in there would be even harder. Your task is starting to seem impossible. You look to your <<beasttype>> for any ideas, but <<bhe>> seems as clueless as you. Your wings have started getting tired from so much gliding. <<tiredness 16>><<ggtiredness>>
<br><br>

As you're about to give up hope, you spot a group of four people carrying a secure-looking box out of the manor. They load it up into one of the vans, and get in. The van then drives out of the estate and turns towards the moor. This could be your only chance to find that special something! You follow after it.
<br><br>

<<link [[Next|Bird Hunt Estate Scout 3]]>><<bird_pass 15>><</link>>

<<effects>><<set $location to "moor">>

You fly after the van. It can't go very fast in the rough terrain of the moor, allowing you to keep up easily. After many minutes, it finally stops near a large ridge in the ground.
<br><br>

The people get out and start unloading supplies. Three of them take out a bunch of nets and cages while one of them grabs the secure box. You notice the one carrying the box is armed. They walk towards the ridge and enter some shrubbery. You wait for them to emerge again, but they don't. Flying closer, you don't see where they could have gone.
<br><br>

You consider landing, but a look from your <<if $monster is 1>><<nnpc_wife "Great Hawk">><<else>>partner<</if>> reminds you what you promised to <<bhim>>. You observe the surrounding area. It looks unremarkable from the rest of the moor. Most importantly, there's nothing that would help you ambush the goons when they come back. A sheer drop from above would leave you open to the armed guard.
<br><br>

After waiting around for a while, you see movement in the bushes. You watch them emerge from a hole in the ground, previously hidden by the foliage. The cages they brought now have lurkers in them. They walk back to the car and drive off.
<br><br>

You land once they're far away, immediately relishing in the chance to rest your wings. You decide against following them, instead choosing to investigate the hole. You tell <<your_bird_text>> as much.
<br><br>

<<if $monster is 1>>
	"Can't follow <<wife>> there, the hole looks too small," <<bhe>> says. "Be safe, <<wife>>."
<<else>>
	It's immediately apparent that <<bhes>> too big to follow you. <<bHe>> nuzzles you in reassurance.
<</if>>
You walk past the shrubbery, into the hole. It's more like a small cave entrance, with the ground gently sloping downwards. Wooden supports keep the mouth stable.
<br><br>

<<switch $bodysize>>
	<<case 1 2>>You're easily able to walk down the hole. You're small enough to escape quickly if things go bad.
	<<case 3>>You have to duck as you walk in, and keep your wings tucked to your body. It's a bit cramped. You wonder how the others managed to carry all that equipment in and out.
	<<case 4>>You have to tuck your wings tight to your body, and even then they hit the edges of the entrance. You're practically crawling. You wonder how the others managed to carry all that equipment in and out.
<</switch>>
Once you're through the mouth, it becomes surprisingly spacious. Walking in the dark is hard, but your keen eyesight helps a little. You soon emerge from the tunnel to a large chamber.
<br><br>

The ceiling has a few small cracks, letting in sunlight. Notably, there's one big spot in the middle where a lot of light shines in, right on top of a carved stone pillar. You notice lots of small holes all around you, and one bigger one leading into pure darkness. You hear a loud chittering coming from it. You avoid getting too close to it. Upon closer inspection, you can hear similar chittering coming from some of the smaller holes too. You look around more, but find nothing else of interest.
<br><br>

One thing is clear. Whatever's in that box is used to help capture lurkers. Nets alone wouldn't get them out of a den this big. It'll make for a fine centrepiece for your hoard. Looking at the holes in the cave gives you an idea. Maybe you could use the lurkers as a distraction while you steal whatever they're using.
<br><br>

The chittering begins to grow louder, and you hear movement. You exit swiftly, not wanting to push your luck. With your scouting mission a success and a plan in mind, you exit the cave satisfied.

<br><br>

<<if $monster is 1>>
	"What did <<wife>> find?" <<bhe>> asks,
<<else>>
	<<bHe>> looks curious to hear what you found,
<</if>>
as <<bhe>> lets you start gliding. You describe the inside of the cave to <<bhim>>. Those details don't seem to interest <<bhim>>, until you mention that you plan to steal the object from them while they're in there.
<br><br>

<<if $monster is 1>>
	"But if <<wife>> attacks the landbound in there, I can't help <<wife>>!" <<bhe>> protests. "Too risky."<br>
	You promise <<bhim>> that it's worth trying. <<bHe>> seems to understand that <<bhe>> can't convince you to back down now.
	"I will help <<wife>> how I can," <<bhe>> says.
	You fly closer to <<bhim>> and give <<bhim>> a peck on the cheek. <<bHe>> blushes faintly, surprised by your sudden affection.
<<else>>
	Upon hearing that you want to risk stealing from them in there alone, <<bhe>> screeches in protest.
	<<bHe>> doesn't want you to take such a risk. You promise <<bhim>> that it's worth trying. The <<beasttype>> seems to understand that <<bhe>> can't convince you to back down now.
	<<bHe>> squawks at you, resolving <<bhimself>> to help however <<bhe>> can.
	You fly closer to <<bhim>> and give <<bhim>> a peck on the cheek. <<bHe>> squawks lightly, surprised by your sudden affection.
<</if>>
<br><br>

The rest of the flight goes by in silence. Eventually you land, pushing the curtain aside and pacing as you think everything over again. Stealing from Remy's goons is not going to be easy, but whatever is in that box is sure to be worth it. You just have to follow them back to that cave again.

With the bright light ahead, you have an entirely different perspective of the cave. You can see everything. The light itself is shining so brightly that everywhere it touches almost looks reflective. You can see lurkers coming and going from various small holes, most of which walk towards the middle of the clearing. The <<person3>><<person>> is furthest away from the middle. <<He>> seems to be catching lurkers with nets as they exit the holes. You get a better look at <<his>> face. <<Hes>> wearing some kind of visor with heavily tinted glass.
<br><br>

A bit further ahead, you see the <<person1>><<person>> and <<person2>><<person>>. They too are wearing the same kind of visor, and have more cages and nets around them. They've caught a lot of lurkers already, though they still have room for more. They don't look too focused, so getting past them shouldn't be too hard.
<br><br>

In the middle of the clearing, you see the <<person4>><<person>>. <<His>> visor looks a lot different. It's darker and covers <<his>> whole face, and there's something etched into the glass. Whenever lurkers manage to reach the light in the middle, the <<person>> simply grabs them and shoves them into the cages.
<br><br>

As your eyes get used to the light, you realise it's coming from the now-open box. You try to focus your attention on the object inside, but can't tell what it is from this distance with it shining so brightly. You doubt it will be easy to grab without the <<person>> noticing, so you should be prepared to confront <<him>>.

	The more you look at it, the more you realise how captivating the shine really is. You have a hard time looking away from it, but manage to shake it off after a moment.
<<elseif $innocencestate is 1>>
	For a moment, your vision focuses on it enough to see that it is something rectangular.
<<else>>
	You're having a hard time getting a proper look at what it is. No matter how much you try to focus your vision on it, all you can see is blurry light.
<</if>>
Whatever it is, you know you want it. But first, you have to get close enough to grab it. Looking around, the cave has a lot of rocks and other natural cover you could hide between. You spot the same big hole again. Despite all the light, it still looks pitch black.
<br><br>

You consider what to do next. You should be able to sneak up to the middle if you go carefully between the rocks. You should avoid any lurkers, and more importantly, being seen by the guards. With the visors hampering their vision, you should be able to hide if they get too close. Hiding won't help you against the lurkers, though. You steel your nerves and prepare to sneak forward.

It's a silver bar of quite notable size. It's set up in such a way that the light coming from the opening in the ceiling is reflected and seemingly amplified by it. No wonder it's so well guarded.

	<br><br>

	<span class="green">You open up as many cages as you can and quickly hide again.</span> Some of the lurkers make no move to leave the cage, though most do.

You take it from the central pedestal, where light shines down. The cave immediately becomes much darker.

The <<person4>><<person>> stands up. "There's an intruder! And <<pshe>> has the Lure!"

The silver bar is extremely heavy. You try to run for the exit, but get cut off by the <<person3>><<person>>. "Give that back now and we won't have to hurt ya," <<he>> says. You double back and run the other way, but are intercepted by the <<person1>><<person>> and <<person2>><<person>>. "There's nowhere for you to run, just drop the Lure and I promise we'll go easy on you," <<he>> says.
<br><br>

You dodge their grabs and try to maintain distance, but they eventually corner you to the other side of the cave. The <<person4>><<person>> cracks <<his>> neck and marches towards you.
<br><br>

"I can't deny your skill, <<girl>>. No one's gotten past me before." <<His>> voice reverberates through the now darkened cave, <<his>> visor giving it an eerie undertone. <<He>> brings <<his>> face close to yours, letting you see your own reflection. You see the etchings on the visor clearly; A pair of antlers, each one over where <<his>> eyes would be. Over where your reflection's eyes are. <<stress 12>><<ggstress>>
<br><br>

You back away, holding the silver bar behind you. <<He>> chuckles. "The Lure called to you too, didn't it? It calls to all of the Elk's children. How's about we talk a while? We could use someone like-"
<br><br>

Suddenly, you hear a heavy thumping coming from behind you. It starts slow, but speeds up rapidly. You didn't realise it until now, but you've ended up right in front of the largest hole in the wall. The sound grows louder and louder, and the chittering in the cave becomes overwhelming. The <<person4>><<person>> takes a few steps back. You turn around, and a wiry pink shape in the darkness starts to grow larger. As it approaches, you see the shiny black detailing around it. It's a massive lurker. It lunges out of the hole!
<br><br>

You deftly step aside, leaving the <<person4>><<person>> in its trajectory. It grabs onto <<him>>. "The giant! It's angry that the Lure is-" <<he>> yells as it tries to pull <<him>> into the hole. <<He>> reaches for <<his>> gun, but a pink tendril snaps out from the creature's mouth and immobilises <<his>> arm. You take advantage of <<his>> situation and rush past <<him>>. The others move to give chase, but stop when their captain yells again. "H-hey! Get it off of me! I don't want to become this thing's next meal!"
<br><br>

They hesitate just long enough for you to run by them. The <<person2>><<person>> yells. "Fuck! If <<pshe>> gets away with the Lure, Remy's going to kill us! You help the captain, I'm going after <<phim>>!"
<br><br>

You keep running, not daring to look back. The jagged ground does little to help your escape, but you manage to get out of the main chamber. <<ggtiredness>><<tiredness 12>>

You run as fast as your legs will carry you. You can hear the <<person2>><<person>> running after you now, hot on your trail. Your lungs burn, and it feels like an eternity passes before you finally reach the crack leading out. You rush outside and screech, trying to get the attention of your <<beasttype 4>> as fast as possible. The <<person>> emerges from the hole after you. "Get back here you fucking <<bitch>>!" <<he>> screams through <<his>> panting.
<br><br>

As you feel like you're about to collapse, your screech is returned. Your <<beasttype 4>> swoops down. You're suddenly grabbed by the shoulders and lifted off of the ground. You recognise the feeling: The firm grip of your <<beasttype 4>>'s talons.

You proudly present the silver bar to <<bhim>>. Even here, it still shines brightly.

	You feel like you could keep staring at it for hours. Your <<beasttype>> seems interested too.

	Looking at it for too long starts to make your eyes drift elsewhere. Your <<beasttype>> seems all too happy to keep staring at it, though.

<<else>>
	<<bHis>> eyes look to be shining too as <<bhe>> chirps in joy.
<</if>>
As you turn the heavy bar in your hands, you notice something on the flat bottom.
<br><br>

It's some kind of symbol. A seal, or maybe a manufacturer's mark. A large circle containing a series of twisting, tangled knots, wrapping in on each other in perfect symmetry. The patterns within have the texture of cut wood. As the branches move outwards, they split into smaller and smaller pieces, and no matter how hard you look, you don't see an end to them. It's gouged into the silver itself, yet the ridges within still seem perfect. It's incredibly intricate, far too precise to be done with human hands.
The light catches the symbol as you look, creating a brilliant pattern that seems to persist when you close your eyes. For a moment, it looks just like it did back in the cave.

After a few minutes of rest, you stand up, feeling refreshed.

You tell <<bhim>> you're alright now that you've caught your breath. <<bHe>> nods and walks off to the perch. You realise that you're still holding the silver bar. You still need to decide where to put it. Such a valuable prize deserves its own spot somewhere, but for now you'll just put it in a shaded spot so that the shine won't be too distracting.
