"So? <<pShes>> cute as fuck. Besides, when in Rome..." <<He>> leans down to kiss you.

    You wait until you feel <<his>> weight over you to throw your arms around <<his>> neck, drawing <<him>> into a deep kiss. Your enthusiasm startles the <<person>>, but <<he>> responds in kind.

Soaked in sweat and still somewhat weak, you climb to your feet. Maybe you should try finding a way to cool down.
